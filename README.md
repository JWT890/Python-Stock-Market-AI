# Python Stock Market AI
This is a Python application that checks stock market data from Alpha Vantage, a real time Stock Market API that tracks data for stocks for a period of time.

This application pulls data from an API key you get from Alpha Vantage, https://www.alphavantage.co/, and displays a graph based on a function such as Time Series Daily for example or something such as Weekly or Monthly. 

The first step is go to Alpha Vantage's website and click on the Get Free API button which will prompt you to sign up for free API key access with your email. Once you sign up you will be given a free API key that can put into the program for it to read from.
