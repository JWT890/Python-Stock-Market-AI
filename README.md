# Python Stock Market AI
This is a Python application that checks stock market data from Alpha Vantage, a real time Stock Market API that tracks data for stocks for a period of time.
This application pulls data from an API key you get from Alpha Vantage, https://www.alphavantage.co/, and displays a graph based on a function such as Time Series Daily for example or something such as Weekly or Monthly.
